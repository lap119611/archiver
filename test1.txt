Hello, World! This is a test file for Huffman compression algorithm.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This sentence contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
It uses variable-length codes for different characters based on their frequency.
More frequent characters get shorter codes, while less frequent ones get longer codes.

This results in overall compression when the frequency distribution is not uniform.
The algorithm was developed by David A. Huffman in 1952.

Let's test this compression with various types of content!
